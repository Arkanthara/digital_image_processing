# 

It's not possible to caracterise what each human can see and how !
That's why we define this quantities:

- Intensity
- Radiance
- Luminance
- Brightness

# Human and color vision: cones

To see the colors, humans have 3 types of cones:

- L-cones (65%)
- M-cones (33%)
- S-cones (2%)

NB: There are more than 3 types of cones !
